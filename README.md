Hack the Build 2.0

For taking the attendance of the defence personnel we put
forth the idea of using RFID tags.
In it, we assigned each army officer with their own RFID tags
which was stitched onto their uniforms and each tag included
the entire data regarding that particular officer.
We used RC522 MODULE IN ARDUINO to program the RFID
sensor so that whenever an officer passes through the sensor
, the sensor detects the person.
